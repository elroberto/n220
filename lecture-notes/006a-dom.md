# Document Object Model (DOM)

A specification for browsers to create a model of HTML and how Javascript can interact within it. Not HTML or Javascript, the DOM is a set of rules agreed upon by all modern browser makers. It does two things:

1. Makes the model of the HTML page
2. Controls access and updating the HTML page

The DOM takes a tree structure in that all nodes flow from a single trunk, the Document. Nodes then branch off of the Document object in numerous directions. Nodes can also have child and sibling elements, similar to branches on a family tree. 

## Four Types of Nodes

* Document - The top of the tree i.e. the starting point
* Element - The structural components of the page
* Attribute - The descriptive parts of the element contained inside their open tags
* Text - The content containing element of the page that cannot contain another element
